{"prompt":"Summarize the following paragraph in 2–3 sentences: \"Machine learning systems often benefit from curated datasets where noise is minimized and labels are consistent. A small amount of carefully validated data can outperform a much larger, noisier dataset if the application requires precise predictions. Data versioning and reproducible preprocessing pipelines are critical to ensure experiments can be rerun and results compared.\"","completion":"High-quality, well-curated datasets with consistent labels often yield better model performance than much larger but noisy datasets. Careful validation and reproducible preprocessing (including data versioning) are essential for reliable experimentation and fair comparison of results."}

{"prompt":"Question: List three strategies to reduce overfitting when training neural networks, and briefly explain why each helps.","completion":"1. Regularization (L2 / weight decay): penalizes large weights and discourages overly complex models that fit noise.\n2. Dropout: randomly disables neuron activations during training which forces the network to learn redundant, robust representations.\n3. Data augmentation or larger dataset: provides more diverse examples so the model learns generalizable patterns rather than memorizing training examples."}

{"prompt":"Explain, at a high level, how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves factuality in LLM-generated answers.","completion":"RAG improves factuality by combining an LLM with an external knowledge retrieval step: the system first searches a vector/indexed corpus for relevant documents, then conditions the generation on those retrieved passages. Because the model is given grounded context from the corpus, it is less likely to hallucinate facts and can cite or base responses on the retrieved evidence, improving accuracy for domain-specific or up-to-date queries."}

{"prompt":"Instruction: Expand this short idea into a 3–5 sentence product pitch suitable for an investor: \"An AI assistant that reads legal contracts and highlights risky clauses.\"","completion":"Our product is an AI-driven contract review assistant that automatically reads legal agreements and highlights clauses that pose potential risk. By combining domain-specific language models with curated legal rules and precedent, the assistant surfaces noncompliant or ambiguous terms and suggests safer alternatives. This reduces review time for legal teams from hours to minutes and helps organizations lower contract-related legal exposure. The product targets in-house legal departments and contract-heavy enterprises where speed and accuracy directly impact operational costs."}
{"prompt":"Explain the difference between precision and recall with a small example (binary classification).","completion":"Precision measures the fraction of positive predictions that are actually correct (TP / (TP + FP)). Recall measures the fraction of actual positives that were correctly identified (TP / (TP + FN)).\n\nExample: Suppose there are 10 truly positive emails (spam). A classifier predicts 8 emails as spam, 6 of which are truly spam (TP=6, FP=2). It missed 4 true spam emails (FN=4). Precision = 6/(6+2) = 0.75. Recall = 6/(6+4) = 0.6."}
{"prompt":"Instruction: Create a step-by-step checklist for performing a code review on a pull request for a backend API.","completion":"1. Verify the PR description explains purpose and scope.\n2. Check that tests were added or updated for new behavior.\n3. Review API contract changes (request/response shapes) and ensure backward compatibility.\n4. Look for security issues (input validation, auth checks).\n5. Examine logging and error handling.\n6. Run the test suite locally or in CI.\n7. Verify performance implications (queries, loops) and suggest optimizations if needed.\n8. Confirm docs and changelog updates for public APIs.\n9. Approve or request changes with specific, actionable comments."}
{"prompt":"Task: Produce a short, simple regex that matches dates in YYYY-MM-DD format and explain it briefly.","completion":"Regex: `^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}$`\nExplanation: `\\d{4}` matches four digits (year), `-` matches a hyphen, `\\d{2}` matches two digits (month), another `-`, then two digits (day). Anchors `^` and `$` ensure the whole string matches this pattern."}
{"prompt":"Instruction: Given a long technical paragraph, generate a 1-sentence TL;DR (two lines max). Paragraph: \"Distributed databases must balance consistency and availability, but network partitions make perfect solutions impossible.
